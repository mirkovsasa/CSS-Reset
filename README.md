# CSS-Reset

This version of CSS reset is aimed at new and custom web site makers.
It features mostly reseting and removing all default browser margins in order to have consistent layout across all of them but it features some injections inside like making all default text to be size of 10px instead of default 16px. This will make that all elements will correspont with 1rem being 10px which makes life much easier when you need to be precise and do not want to calculate sizes for various elements. Also img and picture tags are made to be box models instead of inline and defaulted to maximum with of 100% also in goal of easier work experience.

Thank you all for reading and I hope you will find some use for this
